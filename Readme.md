# Just Transition Agentic Pipeline (JTAP)
## Evidence for Place-Based Transition Decisions in England

The Just Transition Agentic Pipeline (JTAP) brings together multiple official datasets to help understand how local areas are positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy. It provides machine-readable evidence at the level of local authorities in England.

### JTAP integrates four national datasets:
1. DESNZ — greenhouse gas emissions
2. DfT — local transport fuel consumption
3. ONS — population estimates
4. IMD 2019 — deprivation (aggregated from LSOA to LAD)

These are cleaned, harmonised, merged, and scored to create a single LA-year table (2011–2023) covering 289 local authorities.

### The system produces:
1. A canonical, joined dataset with emissions, transport energy use, population, and deprivation
2. A Just Transition Index (JTI) combining emissions, transport intensity, and structural conditions
3. A ranked snapshot for any given year (e.g., 2023), showing high- and low-scoring areas
4. Diagnostics that make the process transparent and reproducible

This project is designed for councils, analysts, researchers, and organisations seeking a structured, open-data foundation for transition planning, risk assessment, and place-based policy design.

Current release: England-only, v1.0

Next steps: expand structural indicators, add visualisation tools, and introduce multi-agent automation.
