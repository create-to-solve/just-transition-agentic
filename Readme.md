# Just Transition Agentic Pipeline (JTAP)
## Evidence for Place-Based Transition Decisions in England

The Just Transition Agentic Pipeline (JTAP) is an automated, reproducible system that brings together multiple official datasets to help understand how local areas are positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy. It provides consistent, comparable, machine-readable evidence at the level of local authorities in England.

### JTAP integrates four national datasets:
  DESNZ — greenhouse gas emissions
  DfT — local transport fuel consumption
  ONS — population estimates
  IMD 2019 — deprivation (aggregated from LSOA to LAD)

These are cleaned, harmonised, merged, and scored to create a single LA-year table (2011–2023) covering 289 local authorities.

### The system produces:

  A canonical, joined dataset with emissions, transport energy use, population, and deprivation
  A Just Transition Index (JTI) combining emissions, transport intensity, and structural conditions
  A ranked snapshot for any given year (e.g., 2023), showing high- and low-scoring areas
  Diagnostics that make the process transparent and reproducible

This project is designed for councils, analysts, researchers, and organisations seeking a structured, open-data foundation for transition planning, risk assessment, and place-based policy design.

Current release: England-only, v1.0
Next steps: expand structural indicators, add visualisation tools, and introduce multi-agent automation.
